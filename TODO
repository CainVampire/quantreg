This is quick list of some possible fixes for the next revision of quantreg
Version:  June 25, 2001

1.  Adapt Khmaladze stuff to handle "br" output.

2.  refine the choice of eps parameter in rq.fit.fn  (this has been a
perennial problem.  As several examples show, it is sometimes possible
to get into trouble with the current 1e-6 tolerance with rq.fit.fn
returning NaN's while a  more relaxed tolerance say 1e-4 produces a
good answer, verifiable from "br".

3.  The trim object in rq.test.khmal could be improved.

4.  Now location-scale and location tests need to be done independently
and should be organized to do both together.

5.  Write anova function for rq objects. [Done in v 3.09]

Some other items May 27 2002

1.  Sparse matrix versions for rq.fit.fn and rq.fit.fnc, project underway.
