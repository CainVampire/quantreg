This is quick list of some possible fixes for the next revision of quantreg
Version:  June 25, 2001

1.  Adapt khmaladze stuff to handle "br" output.

2.  refine the choice of eps parameter in rq.fit.fn  (this has been a
perennial problem.  As several examples show, it is sometimes possible
to get into trouble with the current 1e-6 tolerance with rq.fit.fn
returning NaN's while a  more relaxed tolerance say 1e-4 produces a
good answer, verifiable from "br".

3.  The trim object in rq.test.khmal could be improved.

4.  Now location-scale and location tests need to be done independently
and could be organized to do both together.
