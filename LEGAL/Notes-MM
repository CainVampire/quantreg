src/sparseM.h  : dito

src/xlapack.f  : eliminated and
src/Makevars   : add $(LAPACK_LIBS)  {and $(FLIBS) , according to "Writing R Ext."}


DESCRIPTION:
 - version++
 - really  *Depends* , not just 'Suggests' SparseM -- there are too many
   things that don't make sense otherwise
   ===> eliminate  require(SparseM) from R code
	{I think they were not sufficient anyway}

man/qss.Rd : make clear that package  "tripack" is needed for bivariate
	   case; other cleanup

man/rqss.Rd: cleanup in formatting; improved example.
	     {NB: example should *NOT* do rm(list=ls()) !}

---> see ./ChangeLog  for anything newer
	 ===========
