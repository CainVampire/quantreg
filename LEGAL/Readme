By agreement with Insightful Corporation this software is licensed under
the UIUC/NCSA Open Source License that resides in this directory.  This
was done at the request of Doug Martin, in anticipation of including
some version of quantreg in Splus, in 2002, but like many prior occasions
when this was promised, no Splus version was ever released.

As the ../LICENSE  file stipulates the cholesky.f code in the src directory
is still in some sort of purgatory of ambiguity with respect to its license
status.  For all other elements of the package,
it is licensed according to the conventions of GPL 2.
