This directory contains ratfor source for the several routines of the
rq library.  These are not strictly necessary, but they may prove useful
to anyone wanting to look at the source in detail, since the fortran
translation of them by the ratfor compiler is far from readable.

Note added September 17, 2004

Apparently g77 v3.4 doesn't like double precision data statements so
these have been changed to parameter() declarations.  However, this
entailed the dangerous step of installing the SEP ratfor77 translator.
Past experience, and now a bug file in the SEP distro, suggests
that the ratfor switch statement is unlikely to be correctly handled.
Fortunately, none of the included routines in the directory use switch
but caution is undoubtedly indicated.  The fortran produced for rqbr.r
is somewhat different than that produced by my older sun version, and
generates two warnings from g77, but these appear to be harmless.
Famous last words...
